This is using Rails (no db, simple API, with RSpec) and React (with Typescript). No secrets.

To run this app, you have two steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the `api` directory with the varibles required (as you can see at `.env.example`)
2. Simply run `docker-compose up` :whale: and go to http://localhost:3000
